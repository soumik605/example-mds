When I first started to re-design my company website I was very excited to use [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to build the front-end application in the React way. But soon I realised, in the excitement of using the new JS library I completely forgot about the content part. Who will send me dynamic contents?

And seriously this time I was not in a mood to develop a backend app with Rails or NodeJS. Rather I wanted someone else to handle the role of a typical Content Management System (CMS).

React + Redux + Contentful — the concept
========================================

The idea is very simple! There will be a CMS who will serve data through APIs and we will consume those API data in our [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) application.

While I was looking for a ready-made CMS, I came across [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). Contentful is a API-first CMS and they says ‘Editors get a CMS, Developers don’t have to deal with one’.

And we will manage our application’s data flow with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can’t be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers).

So Let’s get our hands dirty with a small blog application powered by — — React-Redux-Contentful.

Getting Started
===============

We can start by creating a project folder and initializing a \`**package.json\`** file with \`**npm init\`**. But to speed up initial setup I’ve created that for you. Just simply follow the [github link](https://github.com/avishekjana/ReactReduxBase) and checkout the repo.

After checkout go to the project folder and install the dependencies with

```
npm install
```

Then start the app with `npm run start` and go to `http://localhost:8080` .

We will write most of our codes in `src` directory. Now let’s setup a basic homepage by creating a new file `./components/posts_index.js` and adding a basic [React component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html).

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';  
class PostsIndex extends Component {  
  render() {  
    return <div> Our blog posts will come here.</div>;  
  }  
}  
export default PostsIndex;
```

Import the `PostsIndex` component `./routes.js` and add it as a `IndexRoute`.

```
import PostsIndex from './components/posts\_index';  
export default (  
  <Route path="/" component={App}>  
    <IndexRoute component={PostsIndex}/>  
  </Route>  
);
```

To make these changes visible, update the `return` statement of `./components/app.js` with the following

```
return (  
         <div>{this.props.children}</div>  
       );
```

Now go to the browser, refresh the page and see the changes.

Fetch blog contents
===================

Next we’ll integrate with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) so we can fetch and show blog posts dynamically.

Steps to setup your Contentful account
--------------------------------------

1.  [Signup at Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/) (you can choose `Free` package, that will be sufficient for now) and create an empty space.
2.  Create a new Content Type and add few fields to it. _I’ve created a content type_ `_post_` _with the following fields:_ `_title_`_,_ `_description_` _and_ `_featuredImage_`_._
3.  Add some contents for the defined content type.
4.  Get your API `access_token` and `space_id` .

Back to our app
---------------

First install the following `npm` packages: `[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)` and `[redux-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-promise)`.

```
npm install axios redux-promise --save
```

Import and use `redux-promise` middleware in `./index.js` file.

```
import promise from 'redux-promise';  
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(promise)(createStore);
```

Making API calls
----------------

Now we will add `fetchPosts` [action creator](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html) in `./actions/index.js` file and use `axios` to make a GET request to Contentful server.

```
import axios from 'axios';export const FETCH\_POSTS = 'FETCH\_POSTS';  
const API\_BASE\_URL = '[https://cdn.contentful.com'](https://cdn.contentful.com');  
const API\_SPACE\_ID = 'buyxxxxxxx';  
const API\_TOKEN = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';export function fetchPosts() {  
  const request = axios.get(\`${API\_BASE\_URL}/spaces/${API\_SPACE\_ID}/entries?access\_token=${API\_KEY}&content\_type=post\`);  
  return {  
    type: FETCH\_POSTS,  
    payload: request  
  };  
}
```

`fetchPosts` action creator will return an `action` , which is nothing but a plain JavaScript object with a `type` property. In Redux [Actions](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html) describe the fact that _something happened_, but don’t specify how the application’s state changes in response. This is the job of [reducers](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html).

To do that we will add a reducer in `./reducers/posts_reducer.js` and handle the response we got from the action.

```
import { FETCH\_POSTS } from '../actions/index';const INITIAL\_STATE = { all: \[\] };export default function(state = INITIAL\_STATE, action) {  
  switch(action.type) {  
  case FETCH\_POSTS:  
    return { ...state, all: action.payload.data.items };  
  default:  
    return state;  
  }  
}
```

Next we will update the application state in `./reducers/index.js` file.

```
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';  
import PostsReducer from './posts\_reducer';  
const rootReducer = combineReducers({  
  posts: PostsReducer  
});  
export default rootReducer;
```

Displaying posts
================

To get our app working, now we’ll promote the `PostsIndex` component to a Redux [container](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html#presentational-and-container-components) in `./components/posts_index.js` file.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';  
import { connect } from 'react-redux';  
import { fetchPosts } from '../actions/index';class PostsIndex extends Component {  
  componentWillMount() {  
    this.props.fetchPosts();  
  }  
  renderPosts() {  
    return this.props.posts.map((post, index) => {  
      return (  
        <article key={post.sys.id}>  
          <h3>{post.fields.title}</h3>  
          <p>{post.fields.description}</p>  
        </article>  
      );  
    });  
  }  
  render() {  
    return (  
      <div>  
        <h2>Blog Posts</h2>  
        {this.renderPosts()}  
      </div>  
    );  
  }  
}  
function mapStateToProps(state) {  
  return { posts: state.posts.all };  
}  
export default connect(mapStateToProps, { fetchPosts })(PostsIndex);
```

Then go to the browser, refresh the page and check the results.

Now the existing UI may look very dull, only few headlines followed by some paragraphs. To give our app a proper layout, I’ve already included [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) in this project. You can simply make use of Bootstrap CSS classes by adding a `className` attribute to the HTML tags. And I leave that part to you.

Wrap Up
=======

React is a very powerful library that makes it easy to build universal apps. Supercharged with Redux and combined with Contentful, you can quickly develop CMS powered blogs and websites.

Though in our application we only used **Content Delivery** APIs of Contentful. Make sure to check out [four content APIs](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/apis/) which can be used for different use cases like adding a new blog post, updating existing posts, fetching media contents etc.

I’ve done some extra coding and added a simple_ [_HTML5 template_](https://html5up.net/story) _to the app, and also_ [_deployed it on Heroku_](https://floating-retreat-17510.herokuapp.com/)_.
